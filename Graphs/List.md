- **Trajan's Algorithm:** The algorithm provides an otpimized solution to find th enumber of critical connections in a fully connected graph. Critical connections are those that when removed split a fully connected graph into different fully connected graphs. 
The problem appears in tests and interviews quite often where it is phrased in formats like connected islands, cities and is moften modified by the introduction of weights to the edges of the graph. 
The algorithm is efficient as DFS is run only once in the graph and each node is visited just once. It is the most time efficient algorithm to find the connected components in a directed graph.
