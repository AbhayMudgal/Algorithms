- **Trajan's Algorithm:** The algorithm provides an otpimized solution to find th enumber of critical connections in a fully connected graph. Critical connections are those that when removed split a fully connected graph into different fully connected components.
The problem can be phrased in the form of connected cities, islands, centers etc.
